	abstract = {The new EPUB 3 specification from the IDPF incorporates a wide range of technologies and functionality that are set to revolutionize electronic publishing. The format is poised to make the static two-dimensional page a thing of the past, introducing the world to new rich multimedia reading experiences and scripted interactivity. But a specification that offers so much can be a daunting thing to learn.  EPUB 3 Best Practices steps in to help fill the knowledge void. Authored by people involved in the development of the specification, and with extensive experience in electronic publishing, this guide will provide you with a solid foundation on which to begin developing your own EPUBs. Topics covered include:  * A comprehensive survey of accessible production features and best practices * A walkthrough of the new global language support features * An introduction to the new multimedia elements and how to use them to embed content * A guide to best practices for authoring of interactive elements and scripting * A review of publication and distribution metadata * Techniques for fixed and adaptive layouts  EPUB 3 Best Practices is a must-read for anyone looking to unleash the potential of the new format.},

	abstract = {Although the digital revolution has made content available to more people than print books ever could, ebooks are still only as accessible as the foundation they’re built on—and all too often the foundation is weak. But that’s changing. With the introduction of EPUB 3, publishers now have the means to create a single rich data source for audiences of all reading abilities.Through practical tips and examples, Accessible EPUB 3 takes you inside the EPUB 3 format and explores how you can enrich and enhance content for all readers. Author Matt Garrish demystifies the process of making content easier to access, demonstrating how accessible practices are intertwined with standard content best practices.Among many techniques, this guide will teach you how to:Add structure and meaning to your publications to make them more usable by accessible technologiesTailor EPUB Navigation Documents for readers requiring either full or reduced navigationCreate media overlays to synchronize human narration with text displayImprove text-to-speech playback by adding SSML, PLS lexicons, and CSS3 Speech functionality},

We state the reasons and discuss advantages for doing this, how we did it, and the costs of changing an established Microsoft Word workflow. As an example, we use one typical sociology article with tables, illustrations and references. We then follow the article from JATS markup through different transformations resulting in XHTML, EPUB and MOBI versions. In the end, we put everything together in an automated XProc pipeline. The process has been developed on free and open source tools, and we describe and evaluate these tools in the article. The workflow is suitable for non-professional publishers, and all code is attached and free for reuse by others.},

	doi = {10.1186/s40561-019-0113-2},
	abstract = {Abstract The number of disabled students is rapidly increasing worldwide, but many schools and universities have failed to keep up with their learning needs. Consequently, large numbers of disabled students are dropping out of school or university. Open Educational Resources (OER) and Open Educational Practices (OEP) contain several relevant features, including the possibility of reusing and remixing, which have led researchers to consider using OER and OEP to facilitate meeting the needs of disabled and functional-diverse students in order to increase their accessibility and e-inclusion capabilities in educational settings. The very limited research to date, however, has provided a limited holistic understanding of accessibility within OER and OEP in order to aid researchers in pursuing future directions in this field. Therefore, this paper systematically reviewed 31 papers to provide insights about functional diversity within OER and OEP. The results obtained highlighted that accessibility is still in its infancy within OER and that researchers should focus more on considering the four accessibility principles — perceivable, operable, understandable and robust — when providing OER. Additionally, while several researchers have focused on several issues related to accessibility within OER, limited focus has been given to assistive technologies using OER. Finally, this paper provides several recommendations to increase accessibility within OER and help design more accessible OER for students with functional diversity.},

This study sought to determine the accessibility of a randomly selected sample of 355 open textbooks using a custom rubric based upon the World Wide Web Consortium’s (W3C’s) Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), version 2.1, primarily at the Levels A and AA. Included books fell into one of four format types: HTML files/websites, PDFs, Microsoft Word documents and EPUBs. The average number of ‘fails’ – instances in which they ran afoul of a rubric category – across the whole sample was 5.93 and the median was 6, out of a total of 14 or 15 categories, depending on the format type. Overall, most of the books did not meet basic accessibility requirements, such as including alternative text for any images, properly coding/tagging any tables and following a logical heading order structure.},
